# Wolf 🐺

Effortlessly compose fictitious Slack messages.

## Usage

After Wolf is added to your workspace, you’ll have a new command: **`/wolf`**. Run it and this will open up:

<img alt="Wolf Modal" width="400" src="https://files.ifvictr.com/2020/06/wolf_modal.png" />

Wolf will take your input, build a message that looks like it came from that user, and share it. Here’s one from **@zrl** in **#lounge**, from one hundred years in the future:

…and this is the only command you need! Have fun with it!
