# 🐺 Wolf

Effortlessly compose fictitious Slack messages.

## Installation

<a href="https://wolf.ifvictr.com/slack/install">
    <img alt="Add to Slack" add="" to="" slack""="" height="40" width="139" src="https://platform.slack-edge.com/img/add_to_slack.png" srcset="https://platform.slack-edge.com/img/add_to_slack.png 1x, https://platform.slack-edge.com/img/add_to_slack@2x.png 2x" />
</a>

## Usage

After Wolf is added to your workspace, you’ll have a new command: **`/wolf`**. Run it and this will open up:

<img alt="Wolf Modal" width="400" src="https://files.ifvictr.com/2020/06/wolf_modal.png" />

Wolf will take your input, build a message that looks like it came from that user, and share it. Here’s one from **@zrl** in **#lounge**, from one hundred years in the future:

<img alt="Wolf Message" width="400" src="https://files.ifvictr.com/2020/06/wolf_message.png" />

…and this is the only command you need! Have fun with it!
